# AutoTask Generator with Next.js and LangChain

An innovative application, **AutoTask Generator**, utilizes the capabilities of Next.js combined with the LangChain framework to automatically generate a task list, aiding users in achieving their specific objectives. This is achieved through the chaining of multiple language models and text analysis tools.

## Introduction

LangChain is a robust framework devised specifically to chain numerous language models and text analysis tools efficiently. With its integration into the Next.js platform, the **AutoTask Generator** app empowers users to input their goals, and in response, obtain a meticulously curated list of tasks to realize that particular goal.

Furthermore, in building this app, we've extended the original tutorial by incorporating serpAPI, enhancing the project's efficiency and capabilities.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the provided URL.
2. Input your desired goal or objective.
3. Witness the magic as you receive an automatically generated list of tasks to fulfill your aspiration.
